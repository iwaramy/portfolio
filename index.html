          <h3>LOGO DESIGN</h3>
          <p>Logo, the visual identity of a company, with its arresting style and simplicity,
             holds the power to narrate the companyâ€™s story to the target audience.</p>

          <h3>BROCHURE DESIGN</h3>
          <p>In print format, a brochure or catalogue design is a miniature painting of your business. Both brochure and catalogue design
            are physical alternatives to your web property.</p>

          <h3>PACKAGING DESIGN</h3>
          <p>You may not realize it, but sometimes a small change in the packaging can prod a sluggish-moving product to
            yield terrific sales at the point of purchase.</p>
